<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Static Epoxy Flooring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dissipative Type</li><li>Conductive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-static epoxy flooring market is primarily categorized into two types: dissipative and conductive. Dissipative flooring is designed to control static electricity by allowing charges to dissipate gradually, making it suitable for areas where sensitive electronic equipment is present. Conductive flooring, on the other hand, provides a direct path for electrical charges to flow to the ground, ensuring a faster discharge of static electricity. Both types are essential in environments like electronics manufacturing and cleanrooms to prevent static-related damage.</p></p>
